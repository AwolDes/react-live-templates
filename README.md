Live templates for WebStorm and React JS

# How to
* In WebStorm, go to Settings > Editor > Live Templates
* Click the green plus button on the side of the window and select "Template Group" and name it "React Shortcuts" or similar
* With the new group highlighted, click the green plus again and select "Live Template"
* The abbreviation can be anything, I'm using the name of the files in this repo. For example `crc` means "custom react component" and so on.
* Paste in the live template from one of the above files
* Done!
